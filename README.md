# AutoGTAV
This repo was a course project I did for Stat 578 Spring 2019 in UIUC. It is to train a model that can drive a car in GTA V by itself. Please refer to [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pkUvuU1fvMsyObso5Gk3Bez5pESasSnd/view?usp=sharing), [Project Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IUPE-PBQe3cPbH130BCtOEr3Hltw_nbX/view?usp=sharing) and [Project Video](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx3c5OmkyyE). The resulting model can drive decently in GAT V after training 20 hrs with 30 gigabytes data on a GTX 1060!
